# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## 🎯 Innovation Highlights

### Smart Space-as-a-Service (SPaaS)
FlexiSpace pioneers the concept of **Space-as-a-Service**, creating a standardized protocol for fractional, time-based "ownership" of urban spaces through smart contracts.

### Liquid Asset Market
Transforms traditionally illiquid real estate assets into a dynamic, liquid marketplace where spaces can be monetized efficiently during off-hours.

### Community-Centric Design
Bridges the gap between underutilized spaces and community needs, fostering local engagement and micro-entrepreneurship.
